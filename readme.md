Popular Movies
-------------------
This is an app that allows for the display of current popular or top rated movies
from themovidedb.org's use of their API.

The project itself is finished, however, I may add a few QOL improvements should I have the time or 
will as I have a lot of material I want to learn in either web dev, computer programming, or android.

#### API KEY requirement
get an api key from themoviedb and place yours in
app/src/main/java/com.josehinojo.popularmovies/MainActivity.java on
line 45 as a string.

##### To do's
undecided:
1. Add more page options/ load more movies for MainActivity when scrolling to the bottom
2. Add see all reviews option for movies with more than one page
